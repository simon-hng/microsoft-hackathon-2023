# Here's the different study programs that the TUM School of Management offers:
- Bachelor in Management & Technology (BMT) features courses in management studies as well as in natural sciences or engineering. We also call it TUM-BWL. It is available in Munich and Heilbronn campus.
- Master in Management & Technology (MMT): consecutive to BMT
- Master in Management & Digital Technology (MMDT) (Heilbronn): is the ideal blend of management, informatics, and technology.
- Master in Management (MiM): is aimed exclusively at engineers and natural scientists who want to receive a wide range of skills in management, law, economics and business. Also available at TUM Campus Heilbronn.
- Master in Consumer Science (MCS): is a truly interdisciplinary program that offers you a combination of management studies with social and consumer sciences. Students choosing this program usually have academic backgrounds in management, economics, sociology or psychology.
- Master in Finance & Information Management (FIM): In the Finance and Information Management (FIM) master's program, students learn how to push digital technologies in finance forward and how to deal with Big Data by integrating technologies.
- Bachelor in Sustainable Management & Technology (BSMT) (Straubing): aims to provide students with basic business knowledge for developing sustainable technologies, products, and processes. Coupled with interdisciplinary and social skills, the aim is to enable our students to support the change towards sustainable companies.
- Master in Sustainable Management & Technology (MSMT) (Straubing): By focusing on sustainability in entrepreneurial thinking and action, this specialization also shapes the profile of the TUMCS for Sustainability and Biotechnology and adds a new component to the portfolio of the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics
