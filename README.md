# TUM Hackathon @Microsoft 
> Submission from team RAGression

## ðŸ‘‘ First place winner! ðŸ‘‘

This project is a submission for the TUM Hackathon focused on building a chat bot for student support using Microsoft technologies. 
The goal of this chat bot is to provide an interactive and efficient way for students to access information, resources, and support related to their academic journey.

## Overview

- **Vector Embeddings**: Our chat bot uses vector embeddings to deliver personalized and context-aware information to students, ensuring a tailored and efficient support experience.
- **Email Automation**: The bot includes an intelligent email module that automatically determines its capability to generate a suitable response. If the bot identifies a limitation, it seamlessly forwards the email to the appropriate contact, ensuring timely and accurate communication.
