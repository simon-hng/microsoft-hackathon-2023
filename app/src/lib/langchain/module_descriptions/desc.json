Closed questions were chosen as they allow the lecturer to test whether the students are able to reproduce different corporate sustainability strategies, the sustainability challenges and chances companies are facing and the impact of sustainability issues upon classical business functions. Open questions are the best way to test whether the students are able to make use of the acquired knowledge to answer practical problems by providing own examples. They need to show that they can critically assess current corporate sustainability and business practices.By writing the term paper, students demonstrate that they are able to observe societal problems faced by corporations or entrepreneurs. They will be able to offer solutions to these problems by elaborating on a business case or a business plan.

Surveys report that an overwhelming majority of executive managers believe sustainability will be critical to their company’s future success, but they point to key challenges such as the complexity of implementing sustainable practices across business functions, competing strategic priorities, low consumer interest and willingness to buy/pay, or lack of recognition from the financial markets.

Many countries have set ambitious renewable resource integration targets. Achieving these targets requires fundamental changes to the management of the electric power grid since the output of many renewable sources, such as wind and solar, is highly variable it cannot be controlled on demand, exhibits large fluctuations, and is uncertain. Thus, instead of scheduling power supply to satisfy demand, a growing fraction of the demand will have to be managed to match variable renewable generation. In addition to traditional large scale energy storage, distributed flexible loads and storage on the distribution level, for instance in heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat pumps, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), and innovative chemical energy storage will be leveraged to dynamically  align electricity consumption with variable generation. Efforts to coordinate large populations of these kinds of distributed energy storage using information technology are often subsumed under the term Smart Grid. Building Smart Grids requires a deep understanding of the technical and operational characteristics of electric power systems, finding efficient solutions to new optimization problems, developing appropriate data collection and storage methods, and being able to evaluate corresponding systems using model- and data-driven simulations.

It is divided into two parts micro- and macroeconomics.Microeconomics deals with the behavior of individual agents, such as households, firms, and public institutions and with their interaction on markets. How can market demand be derived from the consumption choices of households? How can market supply be derived from the production decisions of firms? Which mechanisms give rise to an equalization of demand and supply? What are the consequences of market failure, and what can the state do about it?Macroeconomics takes an aggregated perspective; it analyzes the economy as a whole. How can economic activity, inflation, and unemployment be measured? What are the factors that determine economic growth? Which mechanisms give rise to economic fluctuations, and how can these fluctuations be mitigated through fiscal and monetary policy?", "Intended Learning Outcomes": "At the end of the module the students will be able to understand and explain the basic principles of economics.
