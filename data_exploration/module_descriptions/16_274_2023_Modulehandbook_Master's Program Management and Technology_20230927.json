Many countries have set ambitious renewable resource integration targets. Achieving these targets requires fundamental changes to the management of the electric power grid since the output of many renewable sources, such as wind and solar, is highly variable it cannot be controlled on demand, exhibits large fluctuations, and is uncertain. Thus, instead of scheduling power supply to satisfy demand, a growing fraction of the demand will have to be managed to match variable renewable generation. In addition to traditional large scale energy storage, distributed flexible loads and storage on the distribution level, for instance in heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat pumps, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), and innovative chemical energy storage will be leveraged to dynamically  align electricity consumption with variable generation. Efforts to coordinate large populations of these kinds of distributed energy storage using information technology are often subsumed under the term Smart Grid. Building Smart Grids requires a deep understanding of the technical and operational characteristics of electric power systems, finding efficient solutions to new optimization problems, developing appropriate data collection and storage methods, and being able to evaluate corresponding systems using model- and data-driven simulations. In this course, we will lay the foundations for students to understand where and how information technology and corresponding computational techniques apply in this area.", "Intended Learning Outcomes": "After successfully completing the module \"Energy Informatics\" students are able to- Understand where & how computer science techniques apply in building a sustainable energy future.- Understand power systems basics to be able to apply computer systems in energy management and in designing a smart power grid.- Understand purpose & current operation of electricity markets to be able to further develop them.- Understand smart grid concepts & components (e.g., advanced metering infrastructure, smart meters, demand response, load shifting, etc.).- Understand properties of variable, non-dispatchable renewables (e.g., wind and solar) and their impact on power systems management.- Understand properties of energy storage.- Understand the possible future role of flexible loads such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs).- Be able to model power systems using state-of-the-art software tools.- Be able to assess integration concepts for renewable resources, energy storage, and flexible loads.", "Teaching and Learning Methods": "The lectures take place as teacher centered teaching based on presentations in lectures.
