A semester-long project\nwork, which ends in the delivery of a business plan and in a presentation. The presentation\nincludes a prototype-demo of the developed product or service and a reflection on how innovative\nentrepreneurs from the guest lectures lead high-tech organizations. Through the projectwork, it is\nassessed how well the participants can identify and implement business opportunities. In teams\nstudents recognize the needs and demands of the customers. Through customer feedback, field\ninterviews and contextual observations they synthesize the identified needs to translate them\ninto clear and significant customer benefits. Students develope business models to learn how to\nbring the idea to the market and position the business with respect to competition. They learn the\nsystematic and iterativ approach of the Business Design for business model, team and technology\ndevelopment.\nSpecifically with the examination deliverables, the participants demonstrate to what extent they\nhave developed the following competences:\n- In their business plan participants formulate in a concise and structured way how they developed\nan understanding about the actual customers and markets for their business idea.\n- In their pitch presentation participants present their business idea before a jury of experts. The\npresentation includes a demo of the prototype for the developed product or service and a refelction\non how innovative entrepreneurs lead high-tech organizations.\nGrading:\n- 30% Prototype: As close to functional prototype as possible, must be interactive\n- 30% Business plan read deck of 7 to 10 slides\n- 40% 8-minute Pitch Presentation\n\nRepeat Examination:\nNext semester\n\nModule Catalog of the study program M.Sc.

The oral examination will typically be for groups of three\nstudents at the same time in order for the students to show their ability to use technical terms\ncorrectly in an academic discussion.\n\nTeaching and Learning Methods:\nThe module consists of a lecture with integrated tutorials. The topics of the lecture are presented\nvia slides. In order to have the students deal in more depths with the topics, these are critically\ndiscussed in the group on a regular basis. At the same time, selected scientific papers are\ndiscussed together with the students. The scientific papers must be prepared by the students\nfor such discussions according to predefined questions. Within the tutorials, the solutions to\nexercise sheets are developed in close cooperation with the lecturers. The exercise sheets contain\nmathematical exercises and case studies. Furthermore, software tools, e.g., for process mining are\nintroduced by the lecturers and applied by the students in the context of the case studies.\n\nMedia:\nPresentation slides, lecture notes, scientific papers, exercise sheets, case studies, software tools\n\nReading List:\nCiriello, R.F., Richter, A., Schwabe, G., 2018.

The written exam may be\nreplaced by an oral examination, however, if the number of participants is low. By answering\nquestions in written form, students show their understanding of the role of information systems\nfor today's and future\u2019s energy system, and hence, of exemplary concepts and approaches in\nthe areas of smart markets, smart grid, smart factory, smart mobility, and smart home. By doing\ncalculations, students demonstrate their ability to work with and apply the mathematical methods\npresented during the lectures and the tutorials. They must also discuss the presented concepts\nand approaches. Students can bring a non-programmable and non-finance calculator, and two\nself-prepared (hand- or machine-written) double-sided DIN-A4 sheets with notes (i.e., in total four\npages with notes). Papers discussed in class can be brought to the exam as long as they do not\ncontain any notes (highlights are allowed).\n\nRepeat Examination:\nNext semester\n\n(Recommended) Prerequisites:\n\nContent:\nIn the first part of the module, students learn about physical and technical basics of energy\nsupply, energy transmission, and energy demand. Moreover, the module addresses the basics\nof sustainable electricity markets and relevant sectors, e.g., mobility. In the second part of the\nmodule, students learn and discuss how digital technologies can help overcome challenges of\nmodern energy systems, for example, the highly relevant topics of a low-carbon energy transition\nor lowering CO2 emissions. The lecture presents insights from various energy-related areas, e.g.,\nsmart markets, smart grid, smart factory, smart mobility, and smart home.\n\nModule Catalog of the study program M.Sc. Finance and Information Management (FIM)\nGenerated on 18.11.2022\n\n23 of 68\n\n \n\fWIBT0002: Digital Energy Management | Digital Energy Management\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes:\nStudents understand the key challenges of low-carbon energy transitions. Moreover, they know\npotential solutions that digital technologies and information systems can offer for these challenges.\nBased on this knowledge, students can evaluate and classify basic techno-economic issues in the\ncontext of energy management. Besides lecture-style teaching, we use interactive elements such\nas discussions of current digital trends, joint analysis of scientific papers, and exercises. Students\nthus not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also gain practically relevant qualifications.\nThe lecture prepares students for jobs in strategic IT management, energy management,\nconsulting, research or business model development, energy-start-ups, utilities, and energy-related\ncompanies.\n\nTeaching and Learning Methods:\nThe course consists of lectures and complementary, interactive tutorials. Exercises are available\nonline before each tutorial, and we develop solutions collaboratively with the students during the\ntutorials. However, students should prepare for the exercises in advance to identify questions and\nto allow for detailed discussions of the identified issues. In the lectures, we discuss topics from a\nscientific and often quantitative perspective. Students should thus have a basic understanding of\nmathematical and statistical models. They should also be willing to follow mathematical reasoning\nand comprehend quantitative research papers. Moreover, we present different approaches and\nmethods to assess various real-world problems and show how scientific results can inform real-\nworld decision-makers.\n\nMedia:\npresentation, lecture notes, excersises, moodle\n\nReading List:\nGoebel C, Jacobsen H-A, del Razo V, Doblander C, Rivera J, Ilg J, Flath C, Schmeck H, Weinhardt\nC, Pathmaperuma D, Appelrath H-J, Sonnenschein M, Lehnhoff S, Kramer O, Staake T, Fleisch E,\nNeumann D, Str\u00fcker J, Erek K, Zarnekow R, Ziekow H, L\u00e4ssig J (2014) Energy Informatics.

They estimate the market potential and analyze the competition.\nThey study feasible marketing strategies, test them on the market and present the results.\nBased on those they develop distribution strategies to reach relevant target groups. Additionally\nconsidering the results of their field tests, interviews and prototypes, the students create scenarios\nfor business models. They identify and evaluate estimations for the financial planning based on\ntested and validated business hypotheses (customer, market, costs, returns \u2026). Finally the results\nare delivered by the team in a business idea presentation. During the presentation students are\nasked critical questions by the examiners. Thereby it can be checked, if students are able to\ndistribute tasks in a team according to competences and experiences, and therefore to test and\nvalidate dozens of hypotheses and to create a business plan in a structured way.\n\nRepeat Examination:\nNext semester\n\n(Recommended) Prerequisites:\nBusiness Plan Basic Course or a similar format\n\nContent:\n- Full-day \"Gr\u00fcnder-Workshop\", topics: Team, Vision, Project Plan \n\nModule Catalog of the study program M.Sc.

The\nrelevant stochastic models for tariff calculation, loss reserving and reinsurance are developed\nand discussed. Different loss-reserving methods are introduced and compared. As non-life\ninsurance (automotive, liability, fire, etc.) is heavily influenced by the random nature of claim\narrivals (frequency) and sizes (severity), stochastic tool such as credibility theory, stochastic\nprocesses, extreme-value analysis and dependence modelling are introduced in the present\ncontext. The role of reinsurance in risk-sharing is analyzed from a mathematical perspective. The\ncurrent regulation (Solvency II) is briefly discussed.\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes:\nAfter successful completion of the module, the students are able to understand and apply the main\nstochastic methods in the practice of (non-life) insurance.\n\nModule Catalog of the study program M.Sc.
