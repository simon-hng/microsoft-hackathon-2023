A semester-long project\\nwork, which ends in the delivery of a business plan and in a presentation. The presentation\\nincludes a prototype-demo of the developed product or service and a reflection on how innovative\\nentrepreneurs from the guest lectures lead high-tech organizations. Through the projectwork, it is\\nassessed how well the participants can identify and implement business opportunities. In teams\\nstudents recognize the needs and demands of the customers. Through customer feedback, field\\ninterviews and contextual observations they synthesize the identified needs to translate them\\ninto clear and significant customer benefits. Students develope business models to learn how to\\nbring the idea to the market and position the business with respect to competition. They learn the\\nsystematic and iterativ approach of the Business Design for business model, team and technology\\ndevelopment.\\nSpecifically with the examination deliverables, the participants demonstrate to what extent they\\nhave developed the following competences:\\n- In their business plan participants formulate in a concise and structured way how they developed\\nan understanding about the actual customers and markets for their business idea.\\n- In their pitch presentation participants present their business idea before a jury of experts. The\\npresentation includes a demo of the prototype for the developed product or service and a refelction\\non how innovative entrepreneurs lead high-tech organizations.\\nGrading:\\n- 30% Prototype: As close to functional prototype as possible, must be interactive\\n- 30% Business plan read deck of 7 to 10 slides\\n- 40% 8-minute Pitch Presentation\\n'>\n",

In the business plan, all aspects of a new\\nbusiness model are partially described. Students particularly show what value proposition they can\\noffer to defined customer groups. They estimate the market potential and analyze the competition.\\nThey study feasible marketing strategies, test them on the market and present the results.\\nBased on those they develop distribution strategies to reach relevant target groups. Additionally\\nconsidering the results of their field tests, interviews and prototypes, the students create scenarios\\nfor business models. They identify and evaluate estimations for the financial planning based on\\ntested and validated business hypotheses (customer, market, costs, returns …). Finally the results\\nare delivered by the team in a business idea presentation. During the presentation students are\\nasked critical questions by the examiners.

A semester-long project\\nwork, which ends in the delivery of a business plan and in a presentation. The presentation\\nincludes a prototype-demo of the developed product or service and a reflection on how innovative\\nentrepreneurs from the guest lectures lead high-tech organizations. Through the projectwork, it is\\nassessed how well the participants can identify and implement business opportunities. In teams\\nstudents recognize the needs and demands of the customers. Through customer feedback, field\\ninterviews and contextual observations they synthesize the identified needs to translate them\\ninto clear and significant customer benefits. Students develope business models to learn how to\\nbring the idea to the market and position the business with respect to competition. They learn the\\nsystematic and iterativ approach of the Business Design for business model, team and technology\\ndevelopment.\\nSpecifically with the examination deliverables, the participants demonstrate to what extent they\\nhave developed the following competences:\\n- In their business plan participants formulate in a concise and structured way how they developed\\nan understanding about the actual customers and markets for their business idea.\\n- In their pitch presentation participants present their business idea before a jury of experts. The\\npresentation includes a demo of the prototype for the developed product or service and a refelction\\non how innovative entrepreneurs lead high-tech organizations.\\nGrading:\\n- 30% Prototype: As close to functional prototype as possible, must be interactive\\n- 30% Business plan read deck of 7 to 10 slides\\n- 40% 8-minute Pitch Presentation\\n\\nRepeat Examination:\\nNext semester\\n\\nModule Catalog of the study program M.Sc.
